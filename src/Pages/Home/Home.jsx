            <p>
                I am a first year Computer Science student at the University
                of Waterloo. I have passion for AI/ML which was built up from
                watching AlphaGO defeat Lee Seedol in Go. I enjoy physical activites
                such as playing sports and working out. I think physical exercise is
                essential in keeping a healthy mind and body. My goal is to integrate
                AI/ML into daily student activities like studying to help students
                succeed.
